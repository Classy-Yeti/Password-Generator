# Password-Generator

This project was just to refresh my memory for coding in java, I will be updating it to make more complicated password as time goes on. This was just the first step. 

The password generator works by asking a user to enter the number of digits they want for their password and then outputs a password with upper and lower case letters as well as numbers.
